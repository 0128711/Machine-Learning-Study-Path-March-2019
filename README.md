# Machin-Learning---Study-Path
## A complete ML study path, centered around TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn

This repository is intended to provide a complete and organic learning path to getting started with Machine Learning.
It does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high  school math is necessary to understand and implement Machine Learning concepts.
I also **strongly recommend** to buy this phenomenal book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow", which inspired me and has driven most of the organization and hierarchy of the content listed above.
Let's get started!
