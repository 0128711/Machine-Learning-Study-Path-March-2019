# Machin-Learning---Study-Path
## A complete ML study path, centered around TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn

This repository is intended to provide a complete and organic learning path to getting started with Machine Learning.
You will understand both theory and be able to apply it in practice, with hands-on project.
It does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high  school math is necessary to understand and implement Machine Learning concepts.
I also **strongly recommend** to buy this phenomenal book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow", which inspired me and has driven most of the organization and hierarchy of the content listed above.


### I organized the Path in 3 sections:

### - Prerequisites
- Python
- The Math you need
- The Machine Learning landscape

### - Machine learning with Scikit-Learn
- Why Scikit-Learn?
- End-to-End Machine Learning project  
- Classification
- Training models
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Learning and Random Forest 

### - Neural Networks with TensorFlow
- Why TensorFlow?
- Up and Running with TensorFlow
- ANN - Artificial Neural Networks 
- CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks
- RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks
- Training Networks: Best practices 
- AutoEncoders
- Reinforcement Learning

### - Utilities
- Other Resources
