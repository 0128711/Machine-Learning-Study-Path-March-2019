# Machin-Learning Study-Path
## A complete ML study path, centered around TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn

This repository is intended to provide a complete and organic learning path to getting started with Machine Learning.
You will understand both theory and be able to apply it in practice, with hands-on project.

It does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high school math is necessary to understand and implement Machine Learning concepts.

I **strongly recommend** to buy this phenomenal book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow", which inspired me and has driven most of the organization and hierarchy of the content listed above.

A part from this, **every content** listed here is open source and free, most of that coming from the world-renowned universities in the world. 


#### I organized the Path in 4 sections:

#### Prerequisites
- Python
- The Math you need
- The Machine Learning landscape

#### Machine learning with Scikit-Learn
- Why Scikit-Learn?
- End-to-End Machine Learning project  
- Classification
- Training models
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Learning and Random Forest 

#### Neural Networks with TensorFlow
- Why TensorFlow?
- Up and Running with TensorFlow
- ANN - Artificial Neural Networks 
- CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks
- RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks
- Training Networks: Best practices 
- AutoEncoders
- Reinforcement Learning

#### Utilities
- Machine Learning Projects 
- Data Science Tools
- Blogs / Youtube Channels / Websites worth taking a look!


So let's get started!

## Prerequisites

### - Python

According to Sun Tzu:
> If you don't know Python, learn it yesterday!

Python is one of the most used and loved programming languages, and it's necessary to get things done in the Machine Learning field. Like most of the frameworks of the bigger Data Science field, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn are written in Python.  

If you don't know the basics, just start from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/).\
Else if you know the syntax and you want to have a more solid Python background (recommended) take this Intermediate Python Course from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/).\
If you are looking for tons of exercises to get your hands dirty and get experience with Python, check [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) and [here](https://www.practicepython.org/).


### - The math you need

Who tells that the math behind Machine Learning is hard... it's not so wrong! But you have to consider that every time you're going to use it, it will be handled by the machine for you! So, the important is to grasp the main concepts and recognize limits and applications of those. No one is going to ask you to calculate a gradient by hand! So, if you are not familiar with these concepts, check them, because they are the reason behind everything.

With these three resources, you'll get out the most of what you really need to understand things deeply.

A top course about linear algebra is [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/).
Integrate with basic probabilities and statistic concepts [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0).
The most of the remaining math you need [here](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html#sec4.5).
