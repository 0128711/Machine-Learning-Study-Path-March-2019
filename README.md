# Machine-Learning Study-Path
## A complete ML study path, centered around TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn

This repository is intended to provide a complete and organic learning path to getting started with Machine Learning.
You will understand both theory and be able to apply it in practice, with hands-on project.

It does not require any previous knowledge, but being confident with programming and high school math is necessary to understand and implement Machine Learning concepts.

I **strongly recommend** to buy [**this**](https://www.amazon.it/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-Tensorflow/dp/1491962291/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/260-9599700-1757805?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1491962291&pd_rd_r=23993915-4513-11e9-ad92-43c54a5a8a65&pd_rd_w=QNr5b&pd_rd_wg=Si7Nj&pf_rd_p=37660d27-94f1-4ebe-be01-184b332a9b15&pf_rd_r=SF0KMBGABMY3T790JY7Z&psc=1&refRID=SF0KMBGABMY3T790JY7Z) phenomenal book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by  OreillY, which inspired me and has driven most of the organization and hierarchy of the content listed above.

A part from this, **every content** listed here is open source and free, most of that coming from the world-renowned universities and open source associations.

## Prerequisites

### Python

According to Sun Tzu:
> If you don't know Python, learn it yesterday!

Python is one of the most used and loved programming languages, and it's necessary to get things done in the Machine Learning field. Like most of the frameworks of the bigger Data Science field, TensorFlow is married with Python and Scikit-Learn is written in Python.  

If you don't know the basics, just start from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/).\
Else if you know the syntax and you want to have a more solid Python background (recommended) take this Intermediate Python Course from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/).\
If you are looking for tons of exercises to get your hands dirty and get experience with Python, check [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) and [here](https://www.practicepython.org/).

Once you're familiar with Python, take a look at [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html), an important module for math operations, that allows you to import in Python the [Tensor](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/wtf-tensor.html) data type, which is the most used in ML (especially when dealing with Neural Nets).
[It's not a matrix!](https://medium.com/@quantumsteinke/whats-the-difference-between-a-matrix-and-a-tensor-4505fbdc576c)

### The math you need

Who tells that the math behind Machine Learning is hard... it's not so wrong! But you have to consider that every time you're going to use it, it will be handled by the machine for you! So, the important is to grasp the main concepts and recognize limits and applications of those. No one is going to ask you to calculate a gradient by hand! So, if you are not familiar with these concepts, check them, because they are the reason behind everything.

With these three resources, you'll get out the most of what you really need to understand things deeply.

A top course about linear algebra is [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/).\
Integrate with basic probabilities and statistic concepts [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0).\
The most of the remaining math you need [here](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html#sec4.5).


### The machine learning Landscape

Directly from the book cited earlier, this is the most concise and illuminating overview of **what is** and **when you need** machine learning. Let's stop use buzzwords!

## Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

### Why Scikit-Learn

Scikit-Learn one of the most complete, mature and well-documented library for Machine Learning tasks.
It comes out-of-the-box with powerful and advanced models and offers facility functions and for the data science process. 
I post here some explanations of the concepts, examples of applied theory and real project cases, divided by category.

When we learn something new, especially if wide and complex, is necessary to avoid confusion, so 
I tried to create the next steps of the path preferring contents from the same context and authors, when possible.
When not possible, I collected both theory and examples, further some pointers to resources like "best practices for _________".

### End-to-End Machine Learning project 

For a first taste, i suggest you to go through this Kaggle notebook, which is the most classic example of ML task. The goal is trying to predict if a Titanic passenger would have been most likely to survive or not. Many things will be unclear for now, but don't worry, they will be all explained comprehensively later. Is nice to get the picture of the "applied" project, going through the classical steps of the applied Machine Learning (problem framing, data exploration, question forumlation...)

The notebook is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the go-to platform for ML and in general Data Science projects, dataset and offers interesting challenges and ML model experiments.

[This](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) is the notebook: Read it, trying to get the big picture of the process, because some details, functions and code will be clearer later.
